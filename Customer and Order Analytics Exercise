--In this SQL, I'm querying a database with multiple tables in it to analyze the customer and order data.

--1. How many orders were placed in January?
SELECT count(orderID) FROM BIT_DB.JanSales;

--How many of those orders were for an iPhone?
SELECT count(orderID) 
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales 
WHERE Product = "iPhone";

--3. Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February.
SELECT customers.acctnum 
FROM BIT_DB.customers 
INNER JOIN BIT_DB.FebSales
ON customers.order_id = FebSales.orderID;

--4. Which product was the cheapest one sold in January, and what was the price?
SELECT distinct Product, price
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
ORDER BY price ASC LIMIT 1;

--5. What is the total revenue for each product sold in January?
SELECT Product, round(sum(Quantity)*price) AS Revenue
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
GROUP BY Product;

--6. Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101, how many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue?
SELECT Product, sum(Quantity), round(sum(Quantity)*price) AS Revenue
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
WHERE location = "548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101"
GROUP BY Product;

--7. How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time, and what was the average amount spent for those customers?
SELECT count(customers.acctnum), avg(Feb.Quantity*Feb.price)
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales Feb
LEFT JOIN BIT_DB.customers
ON customers.order_id = Feb.orderID
WHERE Feb.Quantity>2;
